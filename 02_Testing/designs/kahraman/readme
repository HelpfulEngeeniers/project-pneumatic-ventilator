Here's an update on the Vortran type device. I managed to build the cad model to an acceptable degree of accurate, I don't have the original device or the dimensions so it's not an exact copy. It is NOT production ready yet, all parts are zero tolerance and there are a few other things that needs work (connection details, springs,diaphragm, threads etc.).
