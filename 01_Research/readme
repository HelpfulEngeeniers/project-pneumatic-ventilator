This is a scan of the physical Army device.

Updated dimensions - more detail of the exhaust port and some updated dimensions.  The narrow part of the injector is a bit narrower than I had originally, 1.70mm vs 2.00mm; the narrow point of the vee may be a bit narrower than shown as well, down to 3.2mm vs 3.39mm in the drawing, it's really hard to tell.  Feedback lines are same throughout, 1.54mm throughout; they may be equal to the injector, or not, also hard to tell for sure.
